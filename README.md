# CornHacksProject
We decided on an app that'll help promote safe drinking.

We have one program that uses the standard output and one that attempts to create a gui framework on the front end (unsuccessfully so far). We also have a "database" file that's a CSV of various alcoholic drinks that can be used as potential options for drinks consumed.
